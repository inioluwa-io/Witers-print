After working as a freelance graphic designer between Brighton and London for a few years, in 2016 I felt in need of a change. I wanted to escape city life and spend more time outdoors. The beauty of freelancing is the freedom to create work on the go anywhere in the world. I’d always dreamt of the great mountains of Canada – there aren’t many countries where you can ski, surf and rock climb all within a few hours drive. So that year, I headed to British Columbia, bought a van, which also became my home on wheels, and worked remotely whilst exploring these incredible landscapes. Life on the road, as I've learnt, requires a different mindset and poses new challenges every day. It’s a pretty wild and special chapter of my life.
